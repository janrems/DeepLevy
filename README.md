# DeepLevy

This project deals with use of deep learning in the stochastic control theory for Levy processes. We use Python, more specifically Pytoch.

In the file JumpNet.py we have code that deals with portfolio optimization problem for jump diffusion. 

In the file OptionPricing we have a script for option pricing.

In the file MertonModel we have a Merton Model implementation with lognormal jumps.

In the file MeanField we work on a mean-field problem for neural networks from paper https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3683722. Currently not working properly!

In the file GenerateSDE we have a simple script for jump diffusion generation and visualisation.

Other files can be ignored.
